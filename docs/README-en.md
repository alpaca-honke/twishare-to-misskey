## Overview

This is a Chrome extension that allows you to share to Misskey (or its derivatives) from the Twitter share button.  
I'll update it as I feel like it.  

- [Official site](https://alpaca-honke.github.io/twishare-to-misskey)  
- [Repository](https://github.com/alpaca-honke/twishare-to-misskey)  
- [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/twishare-to-misskey/fbaifpppndnlbbjcbjdfgbdkoibnipjb)
- [Firefox Addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/ja/firefox/addon/twishare-to-misskey/)

## Features

- When you click the share button for Twitter, a confirmation screen appears and you can choose whether you want to share to Misskey (not Twitter) or not.
    - Of course, you can also share to Twitter if you cancel.
- If there's no Twitter share button, you can still share to Misskey by clicking the share button in the lower right corner.
    - Can be moved and moved out of the way
    - You can hide it.
    - It will be hidden when there are some full-screend something such as videos.
- A share button in the extension popup
- Almost all Misskey (v12 or later) and Firefish (formerly Calckey) are supported
- When sharing a tweet, the content of the tweet can be pasted as a quote in the note
- Remove unnecessary information attached to URLs on certain sites before sharing
    - YouTube: remove IDs that may be involved in tracking
    - Twitter: Delete 2 types of unnecessary information
- Avoid unexpected mention on shared post from Threads
- Secure because it does not store authentication information
- Distribute bookmarklets that have the same functionality as some of the extensions

## Installation

### Safari

Not published for Safari, but it might work... (I don't know because I don't have Apple products)  
(Safari seems to be `browser.storage.sync` unsupported, so this extension using it may not work)  
Get the source code from [release page](https://github.com/alpaca-honke/twishare-to-misskey/releases) and put manifest.json under the chrome directory in the repository root, Please give it a good try.

[Twishare to Misskey Bookamrklet](https://alpaca-honke.github.io/twishare-to-misskey/bookmarklet.html) distributes a bookmarklet that provides the functionality of the Twishare to Misskey share button. Please use this bookmarklet.

Also, [@wareplus@nijimiss.moe](https://nijimiss.moe/@wareplus), a member of nijimiss.moe, provides a Safari shortcut for a similar purpose! ↓ ...  
[Shortcuts, CSS, etc. that I created](https://nijimiss.moe/@wareplus/pages/made_by_wareplus)

Also, if there are people who can create extensions for Safari so that we can properly support Safari, I would appreciate it if you could help us!
(I'm sure I can do it if I try hard enough, but I can't confirm that it works...)
